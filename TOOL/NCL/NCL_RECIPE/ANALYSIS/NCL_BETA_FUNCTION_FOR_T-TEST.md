# betainc

Evaluates the incomplete beta function.

## Prototype

```
	function betainc (
		x  : numeric,  
		a  : numeric,  
		b  : numeric   
	)
```

```
return_val [dimsizes(x)] :  typeof(x)
```

## Arguments

x
upper limit of integration. x may be of any dimensionality. x must be in (0,1) inclusive and can only be float or double.

a
first beta distribution parameter; must be > 0.0. It must be the same dimensionality as x.

b
second beta distribution parameter; must be > 0.0. It must be the same dimensionality as x.

## Return value

The variable returned will be the same type and dimensionality as x.

As of NCL version 4.3.1, if x contains missing values, the return value will contain missing values in the same locations.

## Description

betainc calculates the incomplete beta function. The incomplete beta function ratio is the probability that a random variable from a beta distribution having parameters a and b will be less than or equal to x. The code used is from SLATEC (http://www.netlib.org/slatec/fnlib/). This returns the same answers as the <u>Numerical Recipes</u> [Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986] <u>function betai</u>.

This function is often used to determine probabilities.

Note: in NCL version 4.3.1, this function was updated to handle missing values. If any missing values are inputted, the output array will contain missing values in the same locations.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
  a = 0.5
  b = 5.0
  x = 0.2

  alpha = betainc(x,a,b) 
  print("alpha(x,a,b)="+alpha)

  x = 0.5
  alpha = betainc(x,a,b) 
  print("alpha(x,a,b)="+alpha)
```

The result is:

```
  alpha(x,a,b)= 0.85507
  alpha(x,a,b)= 0.98988
```



### Example 2

The betainc can be used as **a p-Value calculator for the Student t-test**. Let's say a calculation has been made where the degrees-of-freedom (df=20) and a Student-t value of 2.08 has been determined. A probability level may be determined via:

```
df   = 20 
tval = 2.08  
prob = betainc( df/(df+tval^2), df/2.0, 0.5)
print ("prob="+prob)
```

The result is prob = 0.0506. **This is a two-tailed** probability. The <u>one-tailed</u> probability is <u>0.5*prob</u> = 0.0253,
For plotting, users often prefer to plot the quantity:

```
prob = (1.-betainc(x,a,b))*100.  ; probability in %
```
